# What is this repository? 
This is a collection of resources for learning the basics of scRNA-seq analysis. I wrote these scripts during Spring 2024 and used them to train younger undergraduates who would be taking over for me in the Grainger Lab. 

## Data Availability
I have made the OneDrive [folder](https://myuva-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/cn9hws_virginia_edu/EkGd_2ed1GlNpYMHQDpFXZQBu4L7pqZY-CxvOnLJacmaIQ?e=ftl0XI) that holds all of the example data public. 

## General Note
File paths will have to be altered accordingly if you use these scripts.
